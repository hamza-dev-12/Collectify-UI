## 🧠 Motivation

Managing maintenance fees for residential or commercial buildings manually is error-prone and inefficient. Residents forget who paid and who didn’t, and there's often no centralized system to track these dues.

Collectify solves this problem by offering:

- Centralized group-based payment management.
- Visual insights into paid and pending amounts.
- A smart assistant to query group status effortlessly.
